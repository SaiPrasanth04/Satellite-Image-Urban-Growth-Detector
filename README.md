# Satellite-Image-Urban-Growth-Detector
This project leverages Machine Learning for data preprocessing and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify satellite images as urban or non-urban. It enables accurate urban growth detection to support sustainable city planning.

The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggleâ€™s Global Land Cover Mapping (OpenEarthMap) dataset, which contains large-scale satellite imagery for land classification. Since the dataset size is approximately 9GB, it cannot be uploaded directly here, and therefore it should be downloaded from Kaggle using the link provided below.
